# Analysis of the Agent Report

## Background
Using the Agents Report from Nov 2017, I am doing some EDA on this limited dataset. Key questions looking to be answered is:

* How long does it take for properties to be sold
* What is the average value of properties sold (per region/area)
* Any other insights from this work?


## Work done
* EDA of median/mean days to be sold
* EDA of mean price


## To Dos
* Clean data - get rid of Null/Error values
* Do some research to validate these initial findings
* Separate out London agents from rest of the country (can they be unfairly weighting the results)
* Split results between agents who are part of a group and those that aren't
* Work out annual property sales profile (how representative is this data of the rest of the year)
* Segment by region - ultimately want to be able to work out how long it takes to sell a property. Best to do this by region
